After completing the highly selective, four month intensive Makers Academy Ronin coding course I am now actively pursuing a career in web development. I have a special interest in the design aspect of coding, but get a genuine buzz working on all areas of the process.

I enjoy the challenge of problem solving. I've become very adapt at figuring things out by myself, and cutting down and simplifying complex problems to make them more straightforward and easier to solve, but I also know when to yell for help.

Prior to this I spent the majority of my working life as a DJ and Broadcaster, both in the UK and US, so I am now looking for new, exciting challenges and an opportunity to advance my coding skills by working with experienced developers on challenging and engaging projects.

## Skills

I've had a love of computers, coding and tech since my formulative years. I taught myself HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP/MySQL purely out of curiosity of how things work, and enjoyed working on the occasional part-time project for the past decade or so. But the Makers Academy bootcamp opened my eyes to a significantly better way of doing things. I have levelled-up my abilities, and now feel able to tackle a much wider range of software development tasks, and approach them in the correct fashion.

Using the principles of agile software development, I have appraoched every project by implementing TDD/BDD and recently built apps and websites in Ruby, Rails and JavaScript/JQuery, whilst using testing frameworks including Rspec, Jasmine, Capybara, Sinatra, Protractor and Angular. I've learnt the importance of building a Minimum Viable Product, writing clear and concise user stories and constructing cohesive Domain Models. I've become adapt with using Git for version control, and working as part of a team via both pair and mob programming.

Outside of this I am proficient in Photoshop, digital video creation and editing, audio mixing and editing. Many of these aspects have come in extrememly handy whilst working on web design projects. I also own and oversee the popular blogzine style website WarpedFactor.com, A 'geek' themed site which receives approximately 10,000 visitors per day. I've never paid for any external advertising but utilised my skills in using social media sites to my advantage, along with my knowledge of search engine optimisation.
